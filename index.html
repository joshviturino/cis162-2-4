    <p>Badet, in Norwegian means to bath or soak</p>
    <p> Sometimes it takes nothing more than to seek out the sea to find peace and freedom. The bath at Høysand is a
      floating sauna where you can look out to sea while you get warm and good. You can also jump straight into the
      ocean if it's
      tempting. We think this feeling is one of the most magical✨ ♥ ️
      Høysand is a popular destination for several reasons. The history goes back as far as 1897 when Høisand Bad was
      founded by Nancy Johannesen. The spa at that time offered, among other things, mud baths, pine needle baths,
      seaweed baths, massages and hot tubs. Here you can read more about the exciting history of the venerable Høisand
      Bad.

      Høysand is conveniently located between Halden, Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg, and is approx. 4 minutes away from
      the exit on the E6. Høysand is located in the heart of Skjebergkilen, which is a cabin paradise with several
      thousand berths. Just around the corner you will find Sweden and Whales. With approx. 20 knots speed in a boat
      you will be at Koster or Skjærhalden in half an hour.

      At Høysand you will find offers for young and old. Right near the bathroom is Sandvika bathing place. Here there
      is a bustling life in the summer and good sanitary facilities with outdoor shower.

      At the beach you will also find a spacious grassy plain for sunbathing and play. At Høysand you can play
      volleyball, football on the loop, tennis and mini golf. Or maybe it's most tempting to try your luck on the
      fishing pier?

      There are several dining options here. Both ice cream parlors, pizza bar and restaurant. It is also possible to
      rent function rooms. For those who want a full evening, there is the possibility of accommodation at Høysand
      camping. Here you can tent, park a motorhome or rent small cabins.
